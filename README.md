A Process Management, Best Practice Tracker, and Employee Scheduling Application.

The goal of this application is to keep Employees aware of the best practices of the work they are doing,
to prepare them for common difficulties previously encountered, and provide them previous solutions to
those issues.

An added benifit is the ability to view the historical work accomplished by an employee, which can help track 
employee development, and measure efficiency in completing specific tasks.
